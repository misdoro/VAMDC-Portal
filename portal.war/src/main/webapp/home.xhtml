		<h1>Welcome to the VAMDC portal!</h1>

		<div class="textContent">

			<p>VAMDC aims to be an interoperable e-infrastructure that
				provides the international research community with access to a broad
				range of atomic and molecular (A&amp;M) data compiled within a set
				of A&amp;M databases accessible through the provision of this portal
				and of user software. Furthermore VAMDC aims to provide A&amp;M data
				providers and compilers with a large dissemination platform for
				their work.</p>

			<p>VAMDC infrastructure was established to provide a service to
				a wide international research community and has been developed in
				conjunction with consultations and advice from the A&amp;M user
				community.</p>
